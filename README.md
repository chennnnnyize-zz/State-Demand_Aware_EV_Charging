## Introduction


We design a predictive charging controller by actively incorporating each EV's state-of-charge (SOC) information, which has strong effects on the utilization of dispatchable power during peak hours. Proposed algorithm helps boost utilization of available charging power, especially when there is a congestion of EV charging requests.
